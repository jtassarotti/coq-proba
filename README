Building
-------------------------
Dependencies (listed by opam package name and version)

- coq                       8.7.0
- coq-bignums               8.7.0
- coq-coquelicot            3.0.1
- coq-flocq                 2.6.0
- coq-interval              3.3.0
- coq-mathcomp-ssreflect    1.6.4
- coq-stdpp                 1.1.0

We have not tested compilation under other configurations.

Proof scripts should build by simply typing "make".


HTML Outline of Files
-------------------------
The file readme.html contains an outline of the paper by section with
links to important lemmas and definitions that are mentioned in the
paper. The CoqDoc html that it links to should be distributed as part
of the supplementary material distribution, but it may have been deleted
if you issued a command line "make clean". To rebuild it, please run
"make html".

Plaintext Guide to Files
-------------------------
In case the readme.html does not work, we give a plain text
overview of important files.

All source files are in the subdirectory theories/, so all the
paths we will quote are with respect to that.

- basic/ -- Some miscellaneous files that do not really belong
  anywhere else: extensions to the ssreflect bigop library, 
  tactics for converting between ssreflect nats and standard library nats,
  etc.

- prob/ -- Basic library of results for discrete probability theory.

  * prob.v -- Definition of distributions, random variables, and expectation.
  
  * finite.v -- Specialized lemmas for distributions on finite types.

  * rearrange.v -- Proof that absolutely convergent infinite series can be rearranged.
    This is a matter of pure real analysis, but it is needed for showing that
    countable series over a finite type must be equal to just a finite sum.

  * double.v -- Proof that "summable" double series can be arranged
    without changing their value. This is again a matter of analysis,
    but it is needed for some facts involving products of
    distributions and alternate formulas for calculating expectation.

  * stochastic_order.v -- Facts about distributional equality and
    stochastic dominance.  Various rules showing you can convert a
    stochastic recurrence phrased in terms of pr_eq into one involving
    pr_gt (for instance).

- rec/ -- Proofs of Karp's theorem and extensions, solutions to some
  recurrences (abstractly stated as stochastic recurrences, not yet
  tied to the code (that happens in the next section))

  * karp.v -- Karp's theorem 

  * span2.v -- Extension to binary span recurrences.

  * work2.v -- Extension to binary work recurrences.
  
  * decreasing_rec.v -- Some results about eventual termination of stochastic recurrence.

  * leader_rec, quicksort_rec, counter_rec, log_rec, quickselect_rec --  solutions to various
    recurrences, again, not yet tied to the code that they are derived from (see next section)

- monad/ -- Definitions of probabilistic choice monads, various examples from paper.
  
  * monad.v -- probabilisitic choice monad.
  
  * monad_cost.v -- sequential cost monad.
 
  * monad_par.v -- parallel cost monad.

  * monad_hoare.v -- Hoare-esque rules for reasoning about the monad.

  * quicksort.v -- sequential quicksort implementation

  * quicksort_correct.v -- proof it sorts

  * quicksort_cost.v -- tail bound for number of comparisons for sequential quicksort.


  * par_quicksort.v -- parallel quicksort implementation

  * par_quicksort_correct.v -- proof it sorts

  * par_quicksort_cost.v -- tail bound for span.


  * bst.v -- construction of randomized BST

  * bst_correct.v -- proof that output of random insertion is
    equivalent to inserting some permutation

  * bst_height.v -- tail bound for height


  * leader.v -- randomized leader election

  * leader_cost.v -- tail bound for number of rounds. 

- idxval/ -- This directory is unrelated to the development discussed in the paper. It includes results about the monad of indexed valuations due to Varacca and Winskel.
